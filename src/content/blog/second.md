## Updates

Well, it took a couple hours but I added a search function on the blog page, tag functions for blog post, and a dynamic route tag pages. 

I'm proud of the progress of the website and I really love the aesthetic so far because it's been in my head for a while.

More updates to come after I push this.

To do / Brainstorm:
- File / Image hosting?
- Comments / Guestbook
