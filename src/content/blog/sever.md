# Happy Thanksgiving.
Sometimes I forget things about myself, about my past, the things that I forget are usually the ones that define me. It sounds silly typing it out but I truly do have the tendency to forget canonical facts about the past that have shaped who I am today.

## High Five.
The kid who's still holding his hand out for a high five always comes back to haunt me. Something will happen that reopens an old wound. That digs up an old memory. That pushes me back into before. Sometimes I like to think that I'm strong, and then I remember that it's only because I don't remember a lot. A strength built upon an absence that seems to gush with memories every once in a while is, in my own opinion, not a true strength. The feelings are still as potent as ever. The memories so vivid and visceral. I clearly need to work on this facet of myself. But... maybe once I'm done with the more important problems. For now? I'll repress it once more, again, and again. Until I'm ready.

## Obsession.
I have the unhealthiest obsessions ever. Are you a freak? I'm a freak. I have some interesting quirks and kinks. My obsession feeds them like a mother bird feeds her child. A morsel for each. It's a very strange, very unhealthy, and *eccentric* part of me. I *would* say I don't know why I'm such a way, but I have many ideas why that is. I don't like lying, I simply feign innocence.

## Positivity.
I got some homework done. And actually hydrated a little today. That's kind of all.
