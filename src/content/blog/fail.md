every day is a new life to a wise man. every failure a death to a fool. 
# a2 
a new vector of genesis that comes from the fractured, splintered, mind. the mass unconscious shifts in search of *something* to make them feel different. does the concept of humanity warrant differentiation? most religious text that I know of speak of their followers as part of a flock. art is made in the base(or unbased in some cases, but still connected) idea that the flock will find it appealing. that the artist has created something that garners attention, that provokes thought. that connects the artist to the viewer. products are created in hopes that the consumer will find purpose, that they will rush to empty their pockets for said item. money entrances the sheep towards the stables, it confines.
