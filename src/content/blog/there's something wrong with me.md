# There’s something wrong with me.

I find it hard to pinpoint myself nowadays. I find it hard to know myself. I find it hard to sit down and be present. Like I’m glitching out of time, I spend my days like a drunkard spends money at a bar. The time vanishes and eludes me.

Leaving behind a faint feeling of unease and worry, like a whisper in the wind saying run. It’s scary when I write it out loud. But a part of me doesn’t even care, a part of me doesn’t feel the impact of this emotion past the two seconds after I realize them. They too have gone with the wind.
