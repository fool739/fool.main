# Nobody knows me. 
I don't want for anything more than to reach a place in life where I'm okay. But I never take more than a few steps towards that life. I have no desires, wishes, wants, request, pleads. There is only one singular goal in my life. It screams at me every day. I hear it gnawing in the back of my mind. 

# Nobody hears me.
I talk to people. I listen to people. I see and hear everything. I hear the silences, I keep track. I feel the disconnection, I grab onto it. I like to ask questions. So many questions. They all form a little piece of you within my mind. Everything from the standard, normal questions to questions that simply reveal more than you want. I like asking questions. It's fun to know. Will you answer?

# I sell dreams half off.
I don't lie. The dreams sound great to me too. Of course deep down I know they're simply dreams, but I would love to share them with you. I would love to be there with you. I would love to live it with you. You mean so much more to me than even I know. Isn't that a shame? 

#
Everyone makes me feel so much more real than I know. Than I would like to feel. Than I could feel. I hate everyone, but once in a while I find myself liking everyone. In another place, another time, I'm here to really enjoy it.
