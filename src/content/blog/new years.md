# 2025 Review
## 5/10
In hindsight, a lot of the things that happened to me in 2025 were either just completely out of my control unforseen punishments sent by a depraved and unjust higher being. Or machinations fueled by a lack of urgency and a loss of vision caused by the aforementioned punishments. I'm finding it hard to remember *what* I exactly did the year. But I know it was a lot. From being held at gunpoint, to understanding what it means to be loved. To a *lot* of hospitlizations and hours spent in a state of depersonalization. I also had my first psychotic break that year, it was kind of chill nothing to crazy. But yes, 2025 was a lot. And I feel like that's always going to be life, there is not a person on Earth who hasn't reached a point at least once during the year where they contemplate, "what the fuck is going on?". From the ultra-rich fascistic sexual predators that control our markets to single mothers struggling to take care of their children. From the forty year old men with kids they love and wives they hate, to the single-depressed-khhv-incels who doomscroll boards in an endless search for meaning beyond their degenerative, pathetic, lives. Is that what it means to be human? Is this what it means to live? I believe so. Of course, it doesn't simply end there. But it's for sure on the list.

## The light that floats within a sea of darkness.
I'm not a pessimist, a doomer, nor am I one who thinks too much about their future too much. For the last few years I've seen to harbor this *deep* natal feeling that no matter - I will live the life I want in the end. It doesn't occur to me how long it will take, nor what challenges I'll encounter along the way. But it just manifests within me that *everything will be okay*. It's been like this since I was young. I would never accredit such a great feeling to a God, nor would I ever say it's due to how my parent's raised me. I take full credit for it, I don't care.
## Hopes, Goals.
I'm scaling Verrum this year. The *really* hopeful goal is that I'm able to scale to 10k~ MRR. Is this a shot at the moon? Probably. Do I care? No. Do I believe I can do it? Yes.
- I also don't think I'll touch alcohol or any drugs past the publication of this post.
Before 2025 I never did that shit, but it seem's that I picked up the drug habits, even if I'm not on the same level as normal people. But taking an edible and being high for the whole day is annoying. And when I'm sad the idea of alcohol to drown my sorrows, doesn't sound very healthy for me. Considering my physical conditions. 
- I also want to start building new coping strategies to replace the previously stated 'drug habits' :p. 
- Also, need to get a new car. Preferably an Audi A7, but I might settle for a beater and call it a day. Not driving around anytime I want is annoying.

I have a lot more, but I don't want to write them all here. But yes, 2026 is a year for growth. What will your year look like?
