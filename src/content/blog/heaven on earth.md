# There is a heaven inside you.

There are treasures on Earth that even Heaven doesn’t hold. When you look at someone you love, whether they’re smiling with joy or crying. Do you not feel your connection to them? The anchor that holds you to this material and mortal plane? One of the reasons, maybe even the biggest reason you choose to continue on despite the troubles. Despite the heartbreaks and despite that sadness that comes with being a human. A mortal.

There is a Heaven on Earth. And it is not the one [REDACTED] used to justify the subjugation of Africans. No, not the Heaven they “built”, not the systems they’ve created to ensure their happiness. No, there is a heaven on earth that’s within *you*. Your heaven no matter how drab and boring or complex and infeasible. Is a Heaven to you.

There is a Heaven on Earth, and I am glad to share it with you.

# There’s something wrong with me.

I find it hard to pinpoint myself nowadays. I find it hard to know myself. I find it hard to sit down and be present. Like I’m glitching out of time, I spend my days like a drunkard spends money at a bar. The time vanishes and eludes me.

Leaving behind a faint feeling of unease and worry, like a whisper in the wind saying run. It’s scary when I write it out loud. But a part of me doesn’t even care, a part of me doesn’t feel the impact of this emotion past the two seconds after I realize them. They too have gone with the wind.
