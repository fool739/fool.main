# Is this thing on?
Hello and welcome! This is my first blog post, well, ever. I've always wanted to make my *own* blog post. So I'm really glad that I was able to set this up within a few hours with minor difficulties. There's still more features I want to add such as RSS, tags and search functionality and to spliff up the UI a little bit more but for now this will do. I plan on writing a blog post on various things from life, games, music, stories and a plethora of different topics. I hope I can use this as an archive of myself and thoughts available for *all* to see. 

Stay tuned for more updates, ciao!
